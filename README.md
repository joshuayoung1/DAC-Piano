# DAC-Piano
 Digital Piano using a Digital to Analog Converter
 
 This project was ran specifically on the TM4C123 microcontroller, however, it's also compatible with the LM4F120 microcontroller

The purpose of this project was to learn about Digital to Analog Converters, or DACs.
I also learned to understand how digital data was stored in a computer, which is then used to represent sounds and music.
